### Python Async Project

#### Project Overview
This project explores asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` library. It includes creating and executing asynchronous coroutines, managing concurrency with asyncio tasks, and measuring the performance of asynchronous code.

#### Table of Contents
1. **Modules and Functions**
    - **0-basic_async_syntax.py**: Contains a coroutine that waits for a random delay.
    - **1-concurrent_coroutines.py**: Runs multiple coroutines concurrently and returns their delays in ascending order.
    - **2-measure_runtime.py**: Measures and returns the average execution time of multiple coroutines.
    - **3-tasks.py**: Creates an asyncio task that waits for a random delay.
    - **4-tasks.py**: Modifies previous code to use asyncio tasks for concurrency.

2. **Setup and Installation**
    - Clone the repository.
    - Create and activate a virtual environment.
    - Install dependencies (if any).

3. **How to Run**
    - Detailed instructions on executing the scripts using the command line.

4. **Examples**
    - Example usages of each module with expected outputs.

#### Learning Objectives
- Understand and explain the `async` and `await` syntax.
- Execute an async program with `asyncio`.
- Run concurrent coroutines.
- Create and manage asyncio tasks.
- Utilize the `random` module for generating random delays.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
- Compliance with `pycodestyle`.
- Type annotations and proper documentation for all functions and modules.

This project provides a comprehensive introduction to asynchronous programming in Python, emphasizing practical implementations and performance measurements.
