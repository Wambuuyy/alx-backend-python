# Unittests and Integration Tests

## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing unit and integration tests in Python. You'll learn how to create tests that verify the correctness of individual functions and how to ensure the smooth interaction of different components within a codebase.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Differentiate between unit and integration tests.
- Understand common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations, and fixtures.
- Write effective tests using the `unittest` framework.
- Apply the `mock` library to simulate external dependencies.
- Use the `parameterized` library to test various input scenarios.
- Develop integration tests that validate the functionality of your code end-to-end.

## Project Requirements

- All code should be compatible with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Python 3.7.
- Follow the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.5).
- Ensure all files are executable and have the appropriate shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`).
- Include documentation for all modules, classes, and functions.
- Type annotations are required for all functions and coroutines.

## Project Structure

- **`utils.py`**: Utility functions to be tested.
- **`client.py`**: Contains the `GithubOrgClient` class, which interacts with the GitHub API.
- **`fixtures.py`**: Contains example payloads used in integration tests.
- **`test_utils.py`**: Unit tests for the functions in `utils.py`.
- **`test_client.py`**: Unit and integration tests for the `GithubOrgClient` class.

## How to Run Tests

To execute the tests, use the following command:

```bash
$ python -m unittest path/to/test_file.py
```

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Parameterize a Unit Test
- Write unit tests for the `utils.access_nested_map` function.
- Use `@parameterized.expand` to test multiple input cases.

### 1. Test Exceptions in Unit Tests
- Test that `utils.access_nested_map` raises `KeyError` for invalid paths.
- Verify the exception message using `assertRaises`.

### 2. Mock HTTP Calls
- Test the `utils.get_json` function by mocking HTTP requests with `unittest.mock.patch`.

### 3. Memoization Tests
- Test the `utils.memoize` decorator to ensure it caches function results.
- Mock methods to verify that the underlying method is only called once.

### 4. Parameterize and Patch as Decorators
- Test the `GithubOrgClient.org` method by parameterizing organization names.
- Use `@patch` to mock external HTTP calls.

### 5. Mocking Properties
- Test the `_public_repos_url` property in `GithubOrgClient`.
- Use `patch` to mock the `org` property.

### 6. Mocking and Testing Public Repos
- Test `GithubOrgClient.public_repos` method by mocking relevant properties and methods.

### 7. Parameterize `has_license`
- Test the `GithubOrgClient.has_license` method by parameterizing repository data.

### 8. Integration Test Setup
- Create integration tests for `GithubOrgClient.public_repos`.
- Use `setUpClass` and `tearDownClass` to mock external requests.

### 9. Integration Tests with License Filtering
- Test `GithubOrgClient.public_repos` with license filtering using integration tests.
